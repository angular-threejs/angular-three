 * App Global CSS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Put style rules here that you want to apply globally. These styles are for
 * the entire app and not just one component. Additionally, this file can be
 * used as an entry point to import other CSS/Sass files to be included in the
 * output CSS.
