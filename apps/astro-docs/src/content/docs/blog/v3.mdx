Angular Three v3 is here with Angular 19 support! üéâ

## What's in Angular Three v3

- Angular 19 support üöÄ
- Stable Testing API üß™
- Routed scenes support is back üß≠
- Deprecation removals üóëÔ∏è

### Angular 19 support

Angular Three v3 drops support for Angular 18 and below. This is because Angular 19 comes with a huge change
to the Effect API (Learn more [here](https://riegler.fr/blog/2024-10-15-effect-context/)). While nothing really changes much to consumers,
the way Angular Three utilizes the Effect API changes. From the library perspective, this update also allows for Angular Three components to go `standalone` by default.

That said, there are several benefits of Angular 19 to Angular Three, and its consumers:

- Lighter effects with less microtasks; One of the changes to the new Effect API is that a certain type of effects is scheduled in a smarter way instead of _microtask-ing_ everything.
- Faster execution in some areas; Another change to the new Effect API is that setting signals inside of effects is now allowed. Hence, `untracked` trick or `allowSignalWrites` is no longer needed.
- Decreased library size; With default `standalone: true` and static analysis on `imports` array, Angular Three v3 is able to shed some of its bundle size.

### Stable Testing API

Angular Three Testing API (`angular-three/testing`) has been graduated from Developer Preview. Nothing changes to the API itself. The Testing API
has been used to test a lot of Angular Three usages since its experimental phase and we are happy to announce that it is now stable.

### Routed scenes support

Due to [a fix in Angular Router](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/3839cfbb18fcc70cae5a6ba4ba7676b1c4acf7a0), Angular Three has been _soft deprecating_ the Routed Scene use-case.
However, the support is back in v3 with a solution.

Angular Three implements a custom `RouterOutlet`, `NgtRouterOutlet`, for routed scenes. All it does is to make sure the outlet can provide
the `NgtRendererFactory` when it activates the routed components. This _might_ seem like a workaround to some folks but we believe that it should work correctly
for most use-cases. If you run into any problem at all, please file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three).

Check out the [Routed Scene](/core/advanced/routed-scene) documentation for more information.

### Deprecation removals

#### `NgtObjectEventsHostDirective`

Short-hand host directive for `NgtObjectEvents` has been removed.

```ts
// instead of
hostDirectives: [NgtObjectEventsHostDirective],

// use
hostDirectives: [{directive: NgtObjectEvents, inputs: [/* explicit inputs */], outputs: [/* explicit outputs */]}],
```

#### `NgtsPivotControls` from `angular-three-soba/controls`

The export `NgtsPivotControls` has been removed from `angular-three-soba/controls`. Update your import to `angular-three-soba/gizmos`

#### `erp` input in `NgtrPhysics`

`erp` input in `NgtrPhysics` has been removed as it's been a no-op for a while.

## Conclusion

This is a small major release to make sure Angular Three is not holding you back from Angular 19. Thank you. Happy coding!
