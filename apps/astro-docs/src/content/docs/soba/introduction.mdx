description: Introduction to the Angular Three Soba package
---

Angular Three Soba is currently a port from [React Three Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) to provide a set of utilities and abstractions for building 3D applications with Angular Three.
As the ecosystem grows, we will continue to add more utilities and abstractions to Soba.

## Installation

```sh
npm install angular-three-soba three-stdlib
# yarn add angular-three-soba three-stdlib
# pnpm add angular-three-soba three-stdlib
```

## Entry Points and Peer Dependencies

Angular Three Soba is broken up into several entry points, each entry point requires a set of different peer dependencies.

| Angular Three Soba Version | `three-stdlib` version |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2.0.0-beta.270             | >=2.0.0                |

Here's a table that shows the peer dependencies for each entry point:

| Entry Point     | Peer Dependencies                                                   | Notes                                                       |
