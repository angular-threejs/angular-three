title: fireEvent
description: Details about the Angular Three Testing `fireEvent` method
---

`fireEvent` is a method on `NgtTestBed` that allows us to fire events on any element in the scene graph.

### `fireEvent(element, eventName, eventData)`

`fireEvent` accepts three arguments:

- `element` is the element to fire the event on
- `eventName` is the name of the event to fire. Must be events that are supported by Angular Three events system.
- `eventData` is an optional object that contains the event data

```ts
const { fixture, fireEvent } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);

await fireEvent(mesh, 'click');
fixture.detectChanges();

await fireEvent(mesh, 'pointerover');
fixture.detectChanges();
```

#### `fireEvent.setAutoDetectChanges(auto: boolean)`

After firing an event, a Change Detection is needed with `fixture.detectChanges()` to flush any changes that may have occurred (e.g: signal state changes).

`fireEvent` does this automatically, but we can disable it by calling `fireEvent.setAutoDetectChanges(false)`.

```ts
const { fixture, fireEvent } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
fireEvent.setAutoDetectChanges(false);

await fireEvent(mesh, 'click');
fixture.detectChanges();

await fireEvent(mesh, 'pointerover');
fixture.detectChanges();
```

## Example Scenario

For this example, we will use `fireEvent` to fire `pointerover`, `pointerout`, and `click` events on the cube
and assert the cube's state after each event.

```diff lang="ts"
import { NgtTestBed } from 'angular-three/testing';

describe('SceneGraph', () => {
	it('should render', async () => {
		const { scene, fireEvent, advance } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);

    expect(scene.children.length).toEqual(1);
    const mesh = scene.children[0] as Mesh;
    expect(mesh.isMesh).toEqual(true);

+    expect(material.color.getHexString()).toEqual('ffa500');

+    await fireEvent(mesh, 'pointerover');
+    expect(material.color.getHexString()).toEqual('ff69b4');

+    await fireEvent(mesh, 'pointerout');
+    expect(material.color.getHexString()).toEqual('ffa500');

+    await fireEvent(mesh, 'click');
+    expect(mesh.scale.toArray()).toEqual([1.5, 1.5, 1.5]);
	});
});
```

:::note

We use `color.getHexString()` to compare the color because `material.color` is a `Color` instance, even though we use CSS Color string in the template.

:::

Last but not least, we will use `advance` to test the animations.
