Angular Three Testing provides a set of utilities to help us write unit tests for the scene graphs built with Angular Three.

In test environment, we do not **actually** render the scene graph. Instead, we assert the state of the scene graph against the expected state
to ensure that the Angular Three renderer works as expected.

## Example Scenario

Assuming we have the following `SceneGraph`

```angular-ts
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh
      #mesh
      [scale]="clicked() ? 1.5 : 1"
      (click)="clicked.set(!clicked())"
      (pointerover)="hovered.set(true)"
      (pointerout)="hovered.set(false)"
    >
      <ngt-box-geometry />
      <ngt-mesh-basic-material [color]="hovered() ? 'hotpink' : 'orange'" />
    </ngt-mesh>
  `,
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
class SceneGraph {
  hovered = signal(false);
  clicked = signal(false);

  meshRef = viewChild.required<ElementRef<Mesh>>('mesh')

  constructor() {
    injectBeforeRender(() => {
      const mesh = this.meshRef().nativeElement;
      mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
    })
  }
}
```

The _rendered_ result of the above scene graph is as follows:

<div class="h-96 w-full border border-dashed border-accent-500 rounded">
	<TestBed client:only />
</div>

Our goal is to test the `SceneGraph` component and assert:

- The mesh is rendered
- The material color changes when the mesh is hovered
- The mesh scales when the mesh is clicked
- The mesh rotates by 0.01 radians per frame

First, let's look at `NgtTestBed`
