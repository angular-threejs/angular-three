description: Details about the Angular Three Testing `toGraph` function
---

`toGraph` is a function that allows you to convert a THREE.js object into a simple `NgtTestGraphObject`.

This is useful for snapshot testing as it _at least_ provides the scene graph structure.

:::caution

In many cases, we can use `toJSON` on the THREE.js object to better structure. However, this is not always possible

- The `uuid` property will always be different for each test run making it difficult to do snapshot testing
- Some THREE.objects do not have `toJSON` method and will throw an error when we try to call `scene.toJSON()` from the root

:::

```ts
const { fixture, toGraph } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
fixture.detectChanges();

expect(toGraph()).toMatchSnapshot();

/**
 * For a scene with a single mesh
 *
 * [
 *   {
 *     "type": "Mesh",
 *     "name": "",
 *     "children": []
 *   }
 * ]
 */
```
