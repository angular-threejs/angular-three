title: NgtTestBed
description: Details about the Angular Three `NgtTestBed` utility
---

`NgtTestBed` is a utility from `angular-three/testing` that abstracts `TestBed` to make it easier to test our scene graph components.

## `create()`

`NgtTestBed` exposes a single static method `create` that accepts a Component class and returns an object with the following properties:

```ts
const ngtTestBed = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
ngtTestBed.fixture; // ComponentFixture<NgtTestCanvas>
ngtTestBed.store; // NgtSignalStore<NgtState>
ngtTestBed.scene; // root THREE.Scene
ngtTestBed.sceneInstanceNode; // root Scene local state
ngtTestBed.canvas; // the mocked HTMLCanvasElement
ngtTestBed.destroy; // method to destroy the fixture
ngtTestBed.fireEvent; // method to fire events on an element in the scene graph
ngtTestBed.advance; // method to advance the animation loop manually per frame
ngtTestBed.toGraph; // method to convert the scene graph to a simple object
```


### Options

`create` accepts an optional second argument that allows us to pass in options to customize the `TestBed`.

```ts
const ngtTestBed = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph, {
	mockCanvasOptions: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
	canvasConfiguration: {
	  camera: { position: [0, 0, 5] },
	  shadows: true
	},
	...TestBedOptions,
});
```

- `canvasConfiguration` is an object whose role is similar to `NgtCanvas` inputs.
  :::note

  Options that determine the Color Space like `linear`, `flat`, `legacy` **can** affect the assertions in the test for THREE.js entities that are affected by different color spaces (e.g: `Color`)

  :::
- `mockCanvasOptions` is an object that allows us to customize the mocked canvas element. It accepts `width` and `height` as well as `beforeReturn` which is a function that allows us to return a mocked `HTMLCanvasElement` before the `TestBed` is created.

## Example Scenario

For this example, we will use `scene`, `fireEvent`, and `advance` to test the `SceneGraph` component.

- `scene` allows us to assert the state of the scene graph
- `fireEvent` allows us to fire events on the cube
- `advance` allows us to advance the animation loop manually per frame

```ts
import { NgtTestBed } from 'angular-three/testing';

describe('SceneGraph', () => {
	it('should render', async () => {
		const { scene, fireEvent, advance } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
	});
});
```

With `scene`, we can assert the state of the scene graph. We can assert
however we want to. To keep things simple, we will just assert that the root Scene has a child which is a `Mesh`

```diff lang="ts"
import { NgtTestBed } from 'angular-three/testing';

describe('SceneGraph', () => {
	it('should render', async () => {
		const { scene, fireEvent, advance } = NgtTestBed.create(SceneGraph);
+    expect(scene.children.length).toEqual(1);
+    const mesh = scene.children[0] as Mesh;
+    expect(mesh.isMesh).toEqual(true);
	});
});
```

Next, we will test the `Mesh` events with `fireEvent`
