## Reuse Geometries and Materials

Each Geometry and Material consumes the GPU's resources. If we know certain Geometries and/or Materials will repeat, we can reuse them

### Imperative

We can have static geometries and materials as Component's properties

```angular-ts
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh [geometry]="sphere" [material]="redMaterial" [position]="[1, 1, 1]" />
    <ngt-mesh [geometry]="sphere" [material]="redMaterial" [position]="[2, 2, 2]" />
  `,
})
export class SceneGraph {
  readonly sphere = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
  readonly redMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 'red' });
}
````

We can also store these static objects in a Service to reuse across the application or turn them into Signals.

### Declarative

We can put the Geometries and Materials declaratively on the template so they can react to Input changes; and still can reuse them

```angular-html
<ngt-sphere-geometry #sphere *args="[1, 32, 32]" attach="none" />
<ngt-mesh-basic-material #redMaterial color="red" attach="none" />

<ngt-mesh [geometry]="sphere" [material]="redMaterial" [position]="[1, 1, 1]" />
<ngt-mesh [geometry]="sphere" [material]="redMaterial" [position]="[2, 2, 2]" />
```

:::tip[Did you know?]

Setting `attach="none"` on the Material and Geometry components will prevent them from being attached to the parent, which is a `Scene` in this case.

## On-demand Rendering

> Credit: [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/advanced/scaling-performance#on-demand-rendering)

The SceneGraph is usually rendered at 60 frames per second. This makes sense if the SceneGraph contains constantly moving parts (eg: game). Consequently, this drains the device's resources.

If the SceneGraph has static entities, or entities that are allowed to come to a rest, constantly rendering at 60fps would be wasteful. In those cases, we can opt into on-demand rendering, which will only render when necessary. All we have to do is to set `frameloop="demand"` on the `<ngt-canvas>`

```angular-html
<ngt-canvas [sceneGraph]="SceneGraph" frameloop="demand" />
```
