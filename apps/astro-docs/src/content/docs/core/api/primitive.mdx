description: Details about the Angular Three `ngt-primitive`
---

There are occasions where we have a pre-existing entities that we want to include in our Angular Three Scene Graph,
we can use the `ngt-primitive` element to do this.

```angular-html
<ngt-primitive *args="[model()]" [parameters]="{ scale: 1.5 }" />
```

:::note

Learn more about [`NgtArgs`](/core/api/args)

:::

- `ngt-primitive` always requires `*args` with the entity to render.
- `ngt-primitive` accepts `parameters` which are passed to the entity.
- Attaching works the same for `ngt-primitive`
- Differ from other Custom Elements, Angular Three Custom Renderer does not destroy the entity for `ngt-primitive`

A more realistic example would be to use `ngt-primitive` to render a GLTF model.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ngt-primitive *args="[model()]" [parameters]="{ scale: 0.01 }" />
  `,
  imports: [NgtArgs]
})
export class Model {
  private gltf = injectGLTF(() => 'path/to/model.glb');
  protected model = computed(() => {
    const gltf = this.gltf();
    if (!gltf) return null;
    return gltf.scene;
  });
}
```
