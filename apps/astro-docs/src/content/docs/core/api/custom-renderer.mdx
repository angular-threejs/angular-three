## Catalogue

Angular Three Custom Renderer maintains a **single catalogue** of entities to render. By default, the catalogue is empty.

### `extend`

In order to populate the catalogue, call the `extend` function and pass in a `Record` of entities. Angular Three then maps the catalogue to Custom Elements tags with the following naming convention:

```ts
extend({
  Mesh, // makes ngt-mesh available
  BoxGeometry, // makes ngt-box-geometry available
  /* ... */,
  MyMesh: Mesh, // makes ngt-my-mesh available
})
```

:::tip[Did you know?]

- `extend` should be called outside of the Component/Directive or in the `constructor`. This is before rendering takes place.
- `extend` can be called multiple times and will merge the `catalogue` with the new entities.

  ```ts
  extend({ Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial });
  extend({ OrbitControls });
  ```

:::

### `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`

The `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` is required to use Angular Three elements as Angular does not support custom schemas at the moment.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `<!-- contains custom ngt elements -->`,
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
export class Experience {}
```

:::tip[Did you know?]

Only components that use custom NGT elements need to have `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`. This flag only affects the compiler, not the runtime.

## Property Bindings

We can use property bindings to pass data to any of the NGT elements' properties.

```angular-html {2-4,8}
<ngt-mesh
  [position]="[0, 1, 0]"
  [rotation]="[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]"
  [scale]="1.5"
>
  <ngt-box-geometry />
  <ngt-mesh-standard-material
    color="hotpink"
  />
</ngt-mesh>
```

:::note

Angular Three tries its best to provide some sort of intellisense for the elements but it's not always possible.
Please consult THREE.js documentation for more information about the elements' properties.

:::

### Shortcuts

Some THREE.js entities have different methods to update their values due to performance and how WebGL works. For example, `THREE.Vector3` has a `set` method that accepts a tuple of `[x, y, z]` instead.
On the other hand, if we pass in a `THREE.Vector3` instance, the current `THREE.Vector3` will call `copy` and pass in the new instance instead.

This characteristic is baked into the Angular Three Custom Renderer so it is more intuitive to pass values to these properties.

#### `NgtVector*`

`NgtVector2`, `NgtVector3`, and `NgtVector4` are shortcuts types for `THREE.Vector2`, `THREE.Vector3`, and `THREE.Vector4` respectively.

```angular-html {"accepts a tuple": 2-3} {"accepts a scalar": 4-5} {"accepts an instance": 6-7}
<ngt-mesh

  [position]="[0, 1, 0]"

  [scale]="1.5"

  [rotation]="myRotation"
></ngt-mesh>
```

#### `NgtEuler` and `NgtQuaternion`

Similar to `NgtVector*`, these types are shortcuts for `THREE.Euler` and `THREE.Quaternion` respectively.

#### `ColorRepresentation`

Similar to `NgtVector*`, any elements that accept a `color` property can accept a `ColorRepresentation` type. This is
a THREE.js type and Angular Three Custom Renderer will apply the value properly.

```angular-html {"accept a css color": 2-3}  {"accept a hex color": 5-6} {"accept rgb/hsl": 8-9} {"accept an instance": 11-12} {"accept a hexadecimal number": 14-15}
<!-- different ways to pass in color -->

<ngt-mesh-basic-material color="hotpink" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material color="#ff00ff" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material color="rgb(255, 0, 255)" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material [color]="myColor" />


<ngt-mesh-basic-material [color]="myHexadecimalColor" />
```

### NGT Properties

Aside from the elements' own properties, there are a few properties that are specific to the Angular Three Custom Renderer.

#### `parameters`

All custom elements accept a `parameters` property that accepts an object of properties to pass to the underlying entity.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh-basic-material
  [parameters]="{ color: 'hotpink', side: BackSide, transparent: true }"
/>
```

#### `attach`

This property is used to specify a property on the parent that this element should be **attached** to. Attaching takes into account
the life-cycle of the elements and will automatically detach when the elements are destroyed.

##### Static Value

If the property on the parent is a static value, use Attribute Binding to bind a static `string` to the `attach` property.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh>
  <ngt-mesh-basic-material attach="material" />
</ngt-mesh>
```

This is equivalent to:

```ts
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();

mesh.material = material;
```

:::tip[Did you know?]

- All Geometries have `attach="geometry"` by default.
- All Materials have `attach="material"` by default.

```angular-html
<ngt-mesh>
  <!-- implicitly have attach="geometry" -->
  <ngt-box-geometry />
  <!-- implicitly have attach="material" -->
  <ngt-mesh-basic-material />
</ngt-mesh>
```

:::

##### Nested Path

We can attach to a nested property on the parent by using a dot-separated path.

```angular-html
<ngt-spot-light [castShadow]="true">
    <ngt-vector2 attach="shadow.mapSize" />
</ngt-spot-light>
```

This is equivalent to:

```ts
const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight();
spotLight.castShadow = true;

const vector2 = new THREE.Vector2();
// shortcut is still applied automatically
spotLight.shadow.mapSize.copy(vector2);
```

##### Dynamic Value

We can pass a dynamic value to `attach` property by using Property Binding syntax `[attach]`. When this is the case, `attach`
accepts `Array<string | number>` as well as `string`

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh>
      <ngt-box-geometry />
      @for (color of colors; track $index) {
        <ngt-mesh-basic-material
          [attach]="['material', $index]"
          [color]="color"
        />
      }
    </ngt-mesh>
  `
})
export class MyCube {
  colors = [
    'red',
    'green',
    'blue',
    'yellow',
    'orange',
    'purple',
  ]; // cube has 6 faces
}
```

This is equivalent to:

```ts
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();

mesh.geometry = geometry;
mesh.material = [];

const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange', 'purple'];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
	const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial();
	material.color.set(colors[i]);
	mesh.material[i] = material;
}
```

##### `NgtAttachFunction`

Optionally, we can pass a `NgtAttachFunction` to `attach` property. We are responsible for attaching and detaching the elements.

```angular-ts
import { createAttachFunction } from 'angular-three';

@Component({
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh>
      <ngt-mesh-basic-material [attach]="attachFn" />
    </ngt-mesh>
  `
})
export class Experience {
  attachFn = createAttachFunction<MeshBasicMaterial, Mesh>(({ parent, child }) => {
    const oldMaterial = parent.material;
    parent.material = child;

    // return a clean-up function that will be called when `ngt-mesh-basic-material` is destroyed
    return () => {
      parent.material = oldMaterial;
    }
  })
}
```

#### `priority`

See [Render Priority](#render-priority) for more information.

## Event Bindings

### Pointer Events

:::note

The events system in NGT is completely ported from R3F. For more information, please check [React Three Fiber Events](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/api/events)

:::

| Event Name    | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| click         | If observed, emits when the object is clicked.                      |
| contextmenu   | If observed, emits when the object is right-clicked.                |
| dblclick      | If observed, emits when the object is double clicked.               |
| pointerup     | If observed, emits when the pointer moves up while on the object.   |
| pointerdown   | If observed, emits when the pointer moves down while on the object. |
| pointerover   | If observed, emits when the pointer is over the object.             |
| pointerout    | If observed, emits when the pointer gets on then out of the object. |
| pointerenter  | If observed, emits when the pointer gets on the object.             |
| pointerleave  | If observed, emits when the pointer gets on then out of the object. |
| pointermove   | If observed, emits when the pointer moves while on the object.      |
| pointermissed | If observed, emits when the pointer misses the object.              |
| pointercancel | If observed, emits when the current pointer event gets cancelled.   |
| wheel         | If observed, emits when the wheel is acted on when on the object.   |

### `beforeRender`

:::caution

This is **discouraged** at the moment due to how Angular Zoneless Change Detection works.
`(beforeRender)` handler will trigger change detection on every frame if used with `provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection()`.

In the meantime, [`injectBeforeRender`](/core/utilities/before-render) is a better alternative.

:::

To register a callback in the animation loop, listen to the `beforeRender` event on a NGT element.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh
      (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($any($event))"
    ></ngt-mesh>
  `
})
export class Experience {
  onBeforeRender(event: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<Mesh>) {
    const { object, state } = event;
    // runs on every frame
  }
}
```

When the element is destroyed, the callback will be removed automatically.

#### Render Priority

By default, NGT renders the scene on every frame.
If we need to control this process, we can pass `priority` as **Attribute Binding** with number-string values
to any object whose `(beforeRender)` is being listened to.
When a `priority` is set, we are responsible to render our scene.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh
      priority="1"
      (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($any($event))"
    />
    <ngt-mesh
      priority="2"
      (beforeRender)="onOtherBeforeRender($any($event))"
    />
  `,
})
export class SceneGraph {
  onBeforeRender(event: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<Mesh>) {
    const { gl, scene, camera } = event.state;
    // do something
    gl.render(scene, camera);
    // do something else
  }

  onOtherBeforeRender(event: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<Mesh>) {
    // this runs after the above beforeRender
  }
}
```

### `attached`

This event is emitted when the element is **attached** or **added** to the parent.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh>
      <ngt-mesh-basic-material (attached)="onAttached($any($event))" />
    </ngt-mesh>
  `
})
export class Experience {
  onAttached(event: NgtAfterAttach<Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial>) {
    const { parent, node } = event;
    //       ^? Mesh ^? MeshBasicMaterial
  }
}
```

### `updated`

This event is emitted when the element is **updated**.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  template: `
    <ngt-mesh
      [position]="[1, 1, 1]"
      (updated)="onUpdated($any($event)"
    ></ngt-mesh>
  `
})
export class Experience {
  onUpdated(event: Mesh) { }
}
