title: Raw Value
description: Details about the Angular Three `ngt-value`
---

There are occasions where we want to **declaratively** set a value on a property of the parent element, we can use `ngt-value`
element to do this.

```angular-html
<!-- this saves us the trouble of getting access to the PointLight instance and assign 0.0001 to light.shadow.bias -->
<ngt-point-light>
    <!-- with this, we can declaratively assign a value to shadow.bias; under an ngIf or something similar -->
    <ngt-value [rawValue]="0.0001" attach="shadow.bias" />
</ngt-point-light>
```

:::note

We can achieve the same result by using `parameters` property on the `ngt-point-light` element if we don't have to worry about
the life-cycle of the `ngt-value` or using control-flow with `ngt-value`

```angular-html
<ngt-point-light [parameters]="{ shadow: { bias: 0.0001 } }" />
```
