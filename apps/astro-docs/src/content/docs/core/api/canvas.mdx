title: NgtCanvas
description: Angular Three Canvas API
---

Everything in Angular Three starts with the `NgtCanvas` component.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <ngt-canvas
      [sceneGraph]="SceneGraph"
      [camera]="cameraOptions"
      [shadows]="true"
    />
  `,
  imports: [NgtCanvas],
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class Experience {
  SceneGraph = SceneGraph;
}
```

## Canvas Defaults

If you have both the scene graphs in Vanilla THREE.js and Angular Three, and you see that the one in Angular Three _looks different_, it might be because of the defaults that Angular Three sets for the underlying THREE.js building blocks.

`NgtCanvas` sets up a translucent `THREE.WebGLRenderer` with the following constructor arguments:

- antialias = true
- alpha = true
- powerReference = 'high-performance'

and the following properties:

- outputEncoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding
- toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping

A `window:resize` listener that will update the `THREE.Renderer` and `THREE.Camera` when the container is resized.

From THREE.js 0.139+, `THREE.ColorManagement.legacyMode` is set to `false` to enable automatic conversion of colors based on the Renderer's configured color space. For more on this topic, check [THREE.js Color Management](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Color-management).
