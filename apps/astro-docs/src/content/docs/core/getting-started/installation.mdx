  <TabItem label="Using template repository">
    The easiest way to get started with Angular Three is to use the [template repository](https://github.com/angular-threejs/template)

    The template repository is kept up to date with the latest version of Angular Three.

    :::tip[Did you know?]

    If you have the [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed, you can use the `gh repo create` command to clone the template repository directly from the command line.

    ```shell
    gh repo create <username>/<repository-name>
      --template angular-threejs/template
      --public
      --clone
    ```

    Angular Three provides an `ng-add` schematic to set up `angular-three` and its dependencies.

    ```shell
    ng add angular-three
    ```

  <TabItem label="Nx">
    1. Install `angular-three` as a dependency

    ```shell
    npm install angular-three
    # yarn add angular-three
    # pnpm add angular-three
    ```

    2. Run the `init` generator to set up `angular-three` and its dependencies.

    1. Install `angular-three` and its dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install angular-three three ngxtension
    # yarn add angular-three three ngxtension
    # pnpm add angular-three three ngxtension
    ```

    2. Install `@types/three` as a development dependency.

    ```shell
    npm install --save-dev @types/three
    # yarn add --dev @types/three
    # pnpm add --dev @types/three
    ```

    3. Turn on `skipLibCheck` in `tsconfig.json` file (if haven't already)

    ```json {3}
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "skipLibCheck": true
      }
    }
    ```
