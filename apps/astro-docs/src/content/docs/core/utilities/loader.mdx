description: A utility to inject a loader into your Angular component.
---

`injectLoader` is a utility function that abstracts the process of loading 3D assets.

It accepts:
- A function that returns a `THREE.Loader` constructor
- A function that returns a `string` or `string[]`
- An option object that accepts the following properties:
  - `extensions`: A function that accepts a `THREE.Loader` and returns nothing. It is used to extend the loader with additional functionality.
  - `onLoad`: A function that accepts the loaded data and returns nothing. It is called after the loader has finished loading the data.
  - `onProgress`: A function that accepts a `ProgressEvent` and returns nothing. It is called when the loader emits a progress event.
  - `injector`: An `Injector` instance. It is used to set the Injection Context for the loader

```angular-ts
import { injectLoader } from 'angular-three';

@Component({
  template: `
    @if (gltfResult(); as gltf) {
      <ngt-primitive *args="[gltf.scene]" />
    }
  `,
})
export class Experience {
  gltfResult = injectLoader(() => GLTFLoader, () => 'path/to/model.glb');
}
```
