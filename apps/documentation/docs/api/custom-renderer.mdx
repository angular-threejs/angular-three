Throughout this documentation, when we talk about **Custom Renderer**, we mean the Angular Custom Renderer implementation, not THREE.js Renderer
:::

## Custom Element tags

Since NGT is an [Angular Custom Renderer](https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2), we can control the _tags_ on the template.
Thanks to that, we can take a set of Custom Element tags and create corresponding THREE.js entities from those tags.

The convention of these Custom Element tags is: `ngt-three-js-class-in-kebab-case`

-   `ngt-mesh` -> `THREE.Mesh`
-   `ngt-box-geometry` -> `THREE.BoxGeometry`
-   `ngt-lOD` -> `THREE.LOD`

### `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`

At the moment, Angular **does not** support userland `schemas`. Hence, we need to rely on `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to compile our
application when using Custom Elements tag

```ts
@Component({
    template: `...`,
    schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
})
export class SceneGraph {}
```

:::tip

Only the Components that use Custom Element tags in their template needs `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`. The Angular Compiler will
throw compilation errors if we violate.

:::

## Catalogue

In order to map Custom Element tags to THREE.js entities, NGT creates an internal `catalogue` to keep a dictionary of THREE.js entities.
This is done so the consumers **do not** have to include the whole THREE.js namespace in their application all the time.

To add THREE.js entities to this `catalogue`, consumers use `extend()` function; ideally at the beginning of the `SceneGraph` component

```ts title="scene-graph.component.ts"
import { extend } from 'angular-three';

// call extend here
extend({ Mesh, BoxGeometry });

@Component({
    /*...*/
})
export class SceneGraph {} // SceneGraph can be named anything
```

```ts
@Component({
    template: '<ngt-canvas [sceneGraph]="SceneGraph" />',
    imports: [NgtCanvas],
})
export class SomeFeatureComponent {
    readonly SceneGraph = SceneGraph; // import SceneGraph component above
}
```

:::note

-   It is ok to call `extend()` multiple times with duplications
-   It is ok to call `extend(THREE)` once to include the entire THREE.js namespace. However, the bundle will also include the entire THREE.js namespace

:::

## THREE.js Inputs

We can pass in any THREE.js entities' properties as Inputs to the Custom Element tags.

```html
<ngt-mesh [position]="[1, 1, 1]" [scale]="1.5" [castShadow]="true">
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material color="red" [wireframe]="true" />
</ngt-mesh>
<ngt-ambient-light [intensity]="0.5" />
```

Due to limitations of Angular schemas, we do not have intellisense support here. The best documentation for these Inputs is [THREE.js Documentatation](https://threejs.org)

### Short-cuts

#### `set()`

All Inputs whose underlying object has a `.set()` can accept the same arguments as `set()`. For example, `THREE.Color#set` can accept
a CSS-like color string. Hence, we can pass `color="red"` instead of `[color]="color"` (where `color = new THREE.Color('red')` in our Component code)

```html
<ngt-mesh-basic-material color="red" />
```

#### `setScalar()`

All Inputs whose underlying object has a `.setScalar()` can accept the same arguments as `setScalar()`

```html
<!-- equivalent to [position]="[10, 10, 10]" -->
<ngt-mesh [position]="10" />
```

There are other shortcuts like `copy()`, `fromArray()` etc... The concept is the same but those aren't used as nearly common as `set()` and `setScalar()`

## NGT Inputs

In addition to Inputs that are THREE.js entities' properties, there are several Inputs that are unique to NGT Custom Renderer

### `attach`

This Input is used to specify a property on the parent that this object should be **attached** to. Objects with `attach`
will be taken off their parent when they're not on the template (eg: under an `*ngIf` or some other Structural Directive)

#### Static value

If the property on the parent is known and static, use `attach` as **Attribute Binding** with `string` values.

```html
<ngt-mesh>
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material attach="material" />
</ngt-mesh>
```

This is equivalent to

```ts
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();

mesh.material = material;
```

:::info

-   All Geometries have `attach="geometry"` by default
-   All Materials have `attach="material"` by default

```html
<ngt-mesh>
    <!-- implicit attach="geometry" -->
    <ngt-box-geometry />
    <!-- implicit attach="material" -->
    <ngt-mesh-basic-material />
</ngt-mesh>
```

:::

We can also pass a `dotted.path` to `attach` if the property is nested

```html
<ngt-spot-light [castShadow]="true">
    <ngt-vector2 attach="shadow.mapSize" />
</ngt-spot-light>
```

This is equivalent to

```ts
const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight();
spotLight.castShadow = true;

const vector2 = new THREE.Vector2();
// shortcut is still applied automatically
spotLight.shadow.mapSize.copy(vector2);
```

#### Dynamic value

If we need to pass a dynamic value to `attach`, use `attach` as **Property Binding** with `Array<string | number>` values

```html
<ngt-mesh>
    <ngt-box-geometry />
    <!-- ngForRepeat is an NGT directive. We'll learn about it in a different section -->
    <ngt-mesh-lambert-material *ngFor="let i; repeat 6" [attach]="['material', i]" />
</ngt-mesh>
```

This is equivalent to:

```ts
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh();
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();

mesh.geometry = geometry;
mesh.material = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    const material = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial();
    mesh.material[i] = material;
}
```

#### `NgtAttachFunction`

Optionally, we can also pass an `NgtAttachFunction` to `[attach]`. When this is the case, we are responsible for **attaching** the child onto the parent
as well as **de-attaching** (clean-up phase)

```ts
// we can import this utility from 'angular-three'
import { createAttachFunction } from 'angular-three':

@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh>
            <ngt-mesh-basic-material [attach]="attachFn" />
        </ngt-mesh>
    `,
})
export class SceneGraph {
    // "store" is the NgtStore, which has all information about the NgtCanvas
    readonly attachFn = createAttachFunction<Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial>(({ parent, child /*, store */ }) => {
        const oldMaterial = parent.material;
        parent.material = child;
        // return a clean-up function that will be called when `ngt-mesh-basic-material` is destroyed
        return () => {
            parent.material = oldMaterial;
        };
    });
}
```

## Outputs

### Object3D Events

All of the following Outputs will trigger Change Detection upon invoked. This is intentional as we usually update Component's state with these Events.

| name          | description                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| click         | If observed, emits when the object is clicked                      |
| contextmenu   | If observed, emits when the object is right-clicked                |
| dblclick      | If observed, emits when the object is double clicked               |
| pointerup     | If observed, emits when the pointer moves up while on the object   |
| pointerdown   | If observed, emits when the pointer moves down while on the object |
| pointerover   | If observed, emits when the pointer is over the object             |
| pointerout    | If observed, emits when the pointer gets on then out of the object |
| pointerenter  | If observed, emits when the pointer gets on the object             |
| pointerleave  | If observed, emits when the pointer gets on then out of the object |
| pointermove   | If observed, emits when the pointer moves while on the object      |
| pointermissed | If observed, emits when the pointer misses the object              |
| pointercancel | If observed, emits when the current pointer event gets cancelled   |
| wheel         | If observed, emits when the wheel is acted on when on the object   |

:::info

The events system in NGT is completely ported from R3F. For more information, please check [React Three Fiber Events](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/api/events)

:::

### `beforeRender`

To register a callback in the animation loop, we can listen for `(beforeRender)`

```ts
@Component({
    template: `<ngt-mesh (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($any($event))" />`,
})
export class SceneGraph {
    onBeforeRender(event: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<Mesh>) {
        // call per frame, will not trigger Change Detection
    }
}
```

When the element is destroyed, `(beforeRender)` is unregistered automatically.

:::note
We use `$any($event)` because of Angular limitations on `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`
:::

#### Render Priority

By default, NGT renders the scene on every frame. If we need to control this process, we can pass `priority` as **Attribute Binding** with number-string values
to any object whose `(beforeRender)` is being listened to. When a `priority` is set, we are responsible to render our scene now.

```ts
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh priority="1" (beforeRender)="onBeforeRender($any($event))" />
        <ngt-mesh priority="2" (beforeRender)="onOtherBeforeRender($any($event))" />
    `,
})
export class SceneGraph {
    onBeforeRender(event: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<Mesh>) {
        const { gl, scene, camera } = event.state;
        // do something
        gl.render(scene, camera);
        // do something else
    }

    onOtherBeforeRender(event: NgtBeforeRenderEvent<Mesh>) {
        // this runs after the above beforeRender
    }
}
```

### `afterAttach`

This event emits after the child **has been attached** to the parent

```ts
@Component({
    template: `
        <ngt-mesh>
            <ngt-mesh-basic-material attach="material" (afterAttach)="onAfterAttach($any($event))" />
        </ngt-mesh>
    `,
})
export class SceneGraph {
    onAfterAttach(event: NgtAfterAttach<Mesh, MeshBasicMaterial>) {}
}
```

### `afterUpdate`

This event emits after an object is updated

```ts
@Component({
    template: ` <ngt-mesh (afterUpdate)="onAfterUpdate($any($event))" [position]="[0, 1, 2]" /> `,
})
export class SceneGraph {
    onAfterUpdate(event: Mesh) {}
}
```
